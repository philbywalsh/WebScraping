# WebScraping

Quick and easy way to scrape odds for upcoming Premier League games from BetExplorer.com

The notebook performs the following:

(i) Using Beautiful Soup: scrapes fixtures from this link https://www.betexplorer.com/soccer/england/premier-league/

(ii) Discards unnecessary columns & removes fixtures where no odds are present

(iii) Outputs the odds as a dataframe and as an excel spreadsheet

Heavily inspired by Paul Corcoran's work here: https://github.com/leftsidedcentrehalf/Medium_Football/blob/main/RandomForestEPL.py
